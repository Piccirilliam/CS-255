Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client is DriverPass, the owner wanted a website/application available on all platforms/browsers, that was accessible anywhere with cloud connectivity.  This application is for
people who want to take driving lessons and online practice exams with the ability to view feedback on their progress.
What did you do particularly well?
I feel like I did my best on the case diagram.  I put the most detail into that diagram, and felt like I sufficiently covered the DriverPass program with it.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would probably revise the system diagrams, I tried my best when making them, but I feel I could of done a few things better by adding more detail.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I thoroughly read the transcript and implementing every aspect that the owner was asking for in his system.  The user's needs are very important in this program, as they are paying for a service that can impact the rest of their lives if completed successfully.  Superior ease of use and accessibility are a must, so that the program can be used by anyone and everyone who could benefit from this program.
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I would definitely make use of UML diagrams, as they help paint a full picture of a system that you are designing.  Reading the transcript alone isn't enough.  Everyone needs to know what the schedule for the project will look like and how the different aspects/actors interact in the system.
